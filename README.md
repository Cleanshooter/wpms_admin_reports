WordPress Multisite Admin Reports
=================================

This plugin was orginally inspired by Plugin Stats. I find that as an administrator I needed more information out of WordPress than the standard pages provided. So I decided to create more robust reporting tool. This is the first version so if there are any bugs or issues please report them.

### Future Features ###

 - [ ]Comments Report
 - [ ]Archive and Delete Actions
 - [ ]Options/Configuration/Settings Page
